This perl extension module implements M. Matsumoto's twisted generalized
shift register generator called TT800 as described in his article
published in ACM Transactions on Modelling and Computer Simulation, 
Vol. 4, No. 3, 1994, pages 254-266. 

This implementation is based on the C code by M. Matsumoto
<matumoto@math.keio.ac.jp> available from 
ftp://random.mat.sbg.ac.at/pub/data/tt800.c.

Converted to a perl extension module and enhancements to 
support multiple streams of pseudorandom numbers 
by Otmar Lendl <lendl@cosy.sbg.ac.at>.
